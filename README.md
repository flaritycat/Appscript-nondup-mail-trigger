# Appscript-nondup-mail-trigger
Sending out mails from a spreadsheet, with triggered columns. Editable to the liking.

This script was made for "Hardanger Spillfestival", for the use of sending mails from a single "Google Form" based on triggers.

Howto:
1. Create a new Google Spreadsheet.
2. In column "A" write whatever you want.
3. In column "B" write either "Hi I am a trigger", "Me also trigger" or just some other thing that isn`t a trigger.
4. In the menu, select "Tools" and then Script-editor.
5. Delete the existing text in code.gs and copy/paste the appscript-nondup-mail-trigger code found at
https://github.com/flaritycat/Appscript-nondup-mail-trigger/blob/master/code

Tip: Play around with the script, have fun.

ROW = Column
And sometimes, 1 = 2 (B). You`ll figure it out.
